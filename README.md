# SunDial Daily Planner

## Description:
- This is a daily planner designed like a sundial!
- The current hour will be green, while the past will be red, and the future will be blue.
- You can add events to your planner by typing them into the input box and save them by pressing enter. 
- Upon refreshing the page after 5pm, the events will automatically clear from the day; because you can't schedule things in the past!
- Depending on what time you view the site, will determine what you can see and do. Just like a sundial!
